# Forecast-Regression
Performed univariate and multivariate regression using Excel to forecast airport passenger numbers through 2015 based on historical data.

# Project Objectives
Utilize historical airport passenger data to understand long-term travel patterns.
Apply univariate and multivariate linear regression models in Microsoft Excel.
Forecast airport passenger traffic through the year 2015.

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – used for:
- Importing and processing historical airport passenger data.
- Performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.
- Visualizing data using charts (trendlines, scatter plots, etc.).
- Evaluating model accuracy (R-squared, prediction errors, etc.).

# Outcome
- Built predictive regression models using Excel to estimate annual airport passenger numbers.
- Found a strong correlation between historical trends and future passenger traffic
- Demonstrated Excel’s capability to perform effective regression analysis without advanced programming.
